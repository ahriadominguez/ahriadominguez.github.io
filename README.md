# Ahria Dominguez's Portfolio

## About
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ahria, and I am currently a Clinical Research Associate in the Clinical Health, Emotion, and Neuroscience (CHEN) Lab at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). I am a graduate student in the Data Science program at Bellevue University and will complete my degree in August. Between my schooling and research experience, I have a total of about 5 years of experience in data analysis techniques. I aspire to become a Clinical Psychologist to help people who have experienced various forms of traumatic experiences, including, but not limited to, sexual violence, physical abuse, and neglect. 
In my free time, I love to crochet, play with my dogs, and travel with my husband. 

Below, you can find my professional and academic accomplishments, work history, data science projects, and contact information.

### Data Science Projects:
Listed below are some projects completed during my time in the data science graduate program at Bellevue University that I wanted to highlight.

- __[Predicting Divorce](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Predicting%20Divorce)__
  - A project that uses different classification models (logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and support vector classifier) to predict whether or not a couple would divorce based on a marital questionnaire. Several models were found to be effective in predicting divorce.
    - Tools: _pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, scikit-learn_
    - Skills: _Classifier models, recursive feature selection with cross-validation, grid searches, data visualization, model evaluation_
- __[Predicting Life Satisfaction](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Predicting%20Life%20Satisfaction)__
  - A project that predicts life satisfaction (through the Satisfaction with Life Scale) using several different features from respondents, such as depression, anxiety, and stress scores, traumatic experiences, religious beliefs and behaviors, age, gender, marital status, employment status, income, etc. Several models were performed on the data, including multiple classification and multiple regression models. The most successful model was found to be the Ordinary Least Squares Regression.
    - Tools: _pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, scikit-learn, statsmodels_
    - Skills: _data transformation, classification models, regression models, recursive feature selection with cross-validation, grid searches, data visualization, model evaluation_
- __[Attitudes on Violence Against Women]()__
  - Information on the project will be here.
    - Tools: tools
    - Skills: skills
- __[Find Yesterday's Top 100 Books](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Top%20100%20Books%20of%20the%20Day)__
  - A project that scrapes information from a URL and parses through the HTML data using BeautifulSoup to present the top 100 books based on the site's activity from the day before in a way that is visually pleasing and easy to read.
    - Tools: _requests, re, bs4, ssl, urrlib_
    - Skills: _get requests, HTML parsing, BeautifulSoup, loops, pretty printing_
- __[Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Movie%20Recommendation%20System)__
  - A project that takes user input to give movie recommendations based on the movie they indicated they enjoy by using correlation analyses from other movie ratings. It prints out the top 10 movies with the highest correlations with the user input.
    - Tools: _pandas, numpy, warnings, time_
    - Skills: _correlation analyses, parsing information, error handling, user input scripts_ 
- __[Improving Major League Baseball Attendance](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/MLB%20Attendance)__
  - A project that takes data from the MLB Dodgers team to give recommendations on how to increase fan attendance to the games. Two recommendations were found with one being a major indicator of higher attendance rates.
    - Tools: _pandas, matplotlib.plyplot, corr, scikit-learn, numpy_
    - Skills: _data visualization, correlation analysis, descriptive statistics, linear regression, data-driven recommendations_
- __[Predicting Spam Text Messages](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Predicting%20Spam%20Messages)__
  - A project that takes labeled data, splits it into training and test sets, and predicts whether or not the text message is spam based on the features in the dataset (e.g., subjectivity, polarity, message length, stemmed text, etc.). Multiple classification models were performed, including a random forest classifier model, a logistic regression model, and a support vector classifier model, all of which performed very well in predicting spam messages.
    - Tools: _pandas, scikit-learn, textblob, NLTK, contractions, matplotlib.pyplot_
    - Skills: _data visualization, classification models, vectorization, data transformation_
- __[Weather Generator](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Weather%20Generator)__
  - A project that takes user input of a designated city/state or zip code, finds and parses through the current weather information, and prints it out in a visually pleasant way to the user. The script will continue to loop through their requests until they indicate that they no longer wish to use the weather generator. The script also handles any invalid or unexpected user inputs by instructing them to try again or letting them know that an error has occurred.
    - Tools: _requests, API keys_
    - Skills: _user input scripts, error handling, pretty printing, JSON parsing_
- __[IMDb Movie Lookup System](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/IMDB%20Movie%20Lookup)__
  - A project that takes user input to look up information on any movie using an API key and parsing through the information retrieved from IMDb. The information retrieved includes but is not limited to the title, year, rating (e.g., PG, PG-13, etc.), release date, runtime, genre, director, writer, main actors, plot, available languages, awards, and audience/critic ratings.
    - Tools: _urllib, json, os_
    - Skills: _API keys, JSON parsing, saving files using commands, error handling_
