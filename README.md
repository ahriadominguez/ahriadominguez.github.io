# Ahria Dominguez's Portfolio

## About
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ahria, and I am currently a Clinical Research Associate in the Clinical Health, Emotion, and Neuroscience (CHEN) Lab at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). I am a graduate student in the Data Science program at Bellevue University and will complete my degree in August. Between my schooling and research experience, I have a total of about 5 years of experience in data analysis techniques. I aspire to become a Clinical Psychologist to help people who have experienced various forms of trauma, including, but not limited to, sexual violence, physical abuse, and neglect. 
In my free time, I love to crochet, play with my dogs, and travel with my husband. 

Below, you can find my professional and academic accomplishments, work history, data science projects, and contact information.

### Data Science Projects:
Listed below are some projects completed during my time in the data science graduate program at Bellevue University that I wanted to highlight.

-__[Classifying Facial Expressions](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Classifying%20Facial%20Expressions)__
  - A project that uses several convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify photos of facial expressions into one of seven different categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, or surprise). One model was found to be the most effective, with an accuracy score of __% and a loss of __.
    - __Tools__: _tensorflow, keras, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn_
    - __Skills__: _neural networks, CNN, classification of images, model evaluation, plotting model metrics_
- __[Predicting Divorce](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Predicting%20Divorce)__
  - A project that uses different classification models (logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and support vector classifier) to predict whether or not a couple would divorce based on a marital questionnaire. Several models were found to be effective in predicting divorce.
    - __Tools__: _pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, scikit-learn_
    - __Skills__: _classification models, recursive feature selection with cross-validation, grid searches, data visualization, model evaluation_
- __[Predicting Life Satisfaction](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Predicting%20Life%20Satisfaction)__
  - A project that predicts life satisfaction (through the Satisfaction with Life Scale) using several different features from respondents, such as depression, anxiety, and stress scores, traumatic experiences, religious beliefs and behaviors, age, gender, marital status, employment status, income, etc. Several models were performed on the data, including multiple classification and multiple regression models. The most successful model was found to be the Ordinary Least Squares Regression.
    - __Tools__: _pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, scikit-learn, statsmodels_
    - __Skills__: _data transformation, classification models, regression models, recursive feature selection with cross-validation, grid searches, data visualization, model evaluation_
- __[Attitudes on Violence Against Women](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Beliefs%20about%20Violence%20Against%20Women)__
  - A project that predicts the percentage of agreeance on sentiments of violence against women and predicts the gender of the respondent. The dataset uses a questionnaire that assesses different scenarios of domestic violence and whether or not the respondents agree with the condoning of violence.
    - __Tools__: _pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, scikit-learn, statsmodels_
    - __Skills__: _classification models, regression models, principal component analyses, data visualization_
- __[Find Yesterday's Top 100 Books](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Top%20100%20Books%20of%20the%20Day)__
  - A project that scrapes information from a URL and parses through the HTML data using BeautifulSoup to present the top 100 books based on the site's activity from the day before in a way that is visually pleasing and easy to read.
    - __Tools__: _requests, re, bs4, ssl, urrlib_
    - __Skills__: _get requests, HTML parsing, BeautifulSoup, loops, pretty printing_

    - __Skills__: _data visualization, classification models, vectorization, data transformation_
- __[Weather Generator](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/Weather%20Generator)__
  - A project that takes user input of a designated city/state or zip code, finds and parses through the current weather information, and prints it out in a visually pleasant way to the user. The script will continue to loop through their requests until they indicate that they no longer wish to use the weather generator. The script also handles any invalid or unexpected user inputs by instructing them to try again or letting them know that an error has occurred.
    - __Tools__: _requests, API keys_
    - __Skills__: _user input scripts, error handling, pretty printing, JSON parsing_
- __[IMDb Movie Lookup System](https://github.com/ahriadominguez/ahriadominguez.github.io/tree/main/IMDB%20Movie%20Lookup)__
