    "##### Write-Up\n",
    "This recommendation system was largely based on the article provided in Blackboard (Nair, 2019) (first link under 'References'). The recommender first asks the user if they are interested in receiving movie recommendations. The user can type 'y' or 'n' for yes or no in either capital or lowercase letters (either work, as the script converts the input to lowercase to work with it. If the user says they would like to receive recommendations ('y'), the script first loads in the ratings and movie datasets from the small MovieLens dataset into pandas data frames. Then, it merges those two data frames together based on the 'movieId' column values to create one data frame. The average rating for each move is calculated by grouping the data frame by movie title and taking the mean rating for each. These ratings are placed in an empty data frame, and then the number of ratings are counted by grouping the data again and placing the values in a new column of the newly created data frame 'ratings'. The 'movies' data frame is pivoted to use for correlation calculations by placing each user ID as a row. The 'movie_data,' 'ratings,' and 'users' variables are then passed on to the second function for later use. The first function also has several error handling blocks to handle other inputs besides the expected y/Y or n/N. These will print off a \"try again\" message to let the user know that their response was not accepted. If the user does not want any movie recommendations, they can simply say \"n\" or \"N\" to break the cycle at any time (even at the very beginning). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second function asks the user for a movie in order to find the top 10 recommendations. It specifies that they need to use proper capitalization for the movie titles, and they need to provide the year the movie came out. I did this because I was not sure how to make the movies all lowercase, have the script lowercase any user input, and then compare it to another database that included uppercase letters. I know that some movies have strange capitalizations or numbers/symbols in some spaces, so I wanted to make it as easy on the program as I could, even if that means it's a little bit harder for users to use. The script will then check to see if the user's input is within the column of movie titles and will print out a message saying it is not if it isn't (as well as a reminder to use proper capitalization/punctuation in their input). I had several issues with receiving warnings regarding the division errors when calculation correlations, so I wanted to filter out the movies to only show the ones with more than 100 ratings. I did that, and then I also specified to ignore the errors I was encountering that would not always be stopped by having more than 100 ratings. A new data frame is created with the correlations data, and any NA values are dropped. The new data frame is then merged with the 'ratings' data frame's 'totalRatings' column, and, again, any movies with 100 or fewer ratings are filtered out. Then, the correlations are merged with the 'movie_data' data frame based on the movie's title. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script will print out the top 10 movie recommendations based on the highest correlations to the movie they input into the field, excluding the movie they input (as it would always place that movie first). Any errors are caught in the error handling exception line and will print what error was encountered. The script will continue to loop until the user indicates that they no longer wish to obtain movie recommendations. Then, it breaks out of the loop nicely with a goodbye message. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used the \"if name equals main\" syntax to specify to only run the script if it is not imported as a module. I ran the script a few times above to show that it handles errors well and can also accurately create recommendations based on valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think this is a very successful movie recommendation system. The only thing I would hope to improve would be to make it easier for users by not having them input the year of the movie or worry about the capitalization. "
